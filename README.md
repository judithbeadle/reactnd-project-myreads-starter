# My Reads Project

This is an app that allows users to sort books they have read, want to read or are currently reading.


## Project Overview

Based on the Udacity starter project [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) the app makes use of data from a [Backend Server](#backend-server) to display a range of books and categorize them in one of four categories:

1. currently reading
2. want to read
3. read
4. none

Each of these categories is represented by a "shelf" on the main page, apart from 'none', which removes the book from the main page.
Books can be moved from one shelf to another and more books can be added to these shelfs via a search by author name or title.


## Running the project

In order to get the project running on your local machine, you need to have either yarn or npm installed on your machine.

You can get yarn [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)
Or download [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)


Then follow the steps below:

1. download or clone it to a folder on your computer [https://github.com/judithbeadle/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git](https://github.com/judithbeadle/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git)

2. cd into reactnd-project-myreads-starter and

### if you use npm:

3. install dependencies with: npm install

4. start the project with: npm start

### if you use yarn:

3. install dependencies with: yarn install

4. start the project with: yarn start

This starts the app locally on: `http://localhost:3000`


## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, there is a backend server to develop against. The provided file [BooksAPI.js](https://github.com/judithbeadle/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend.
